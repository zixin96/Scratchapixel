> In general what you need to remember about parametric surfaces, is that it requires 1 parameter to describe a curve and two parameters to describe a 3D surface.

> differential geometry

> So, it is generally easier to support only one geometry type (triangle is the most common choice) and convert other geometry types to that that type instead.
